# 👋 Hey there, I'm Oussama Hajji! Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

I'm a recently graduated engineer in applied mathematics and physics, and I’ve just started a PhD in Particle Physics at the University of Amsterdam. My background is rooted in mathematical modeling and numerical simulation, and I’m now exploring the intersection of subatomic physics and fluid dynamics.

## 👨‍🎓 Academic Background
- 🎓 Engineering degree in Applied Mathematics for Physics.
- 🧪 Scientific Machine Learning Intern at Thales Research & Technology (Mar–Sep 2024): Worked on integrating heterogeneous physical constraints into neural network architectures, enhancing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving Maxwell’s equations in electromagnetic simulations.
- 🔬 Former research intern at INRIA, focusing on Maxwell's equations using PINNs.
- 📍 Currently a PhD candidate at the Institute of Physics (UvA), working on positron particle tracking for fluid dynamics, in collaboration with Nikhef and Soft Matter Group.

## 🌱 Learning Goals
- Particle tracking and detection methods (e.g., PET/PEPT).
- Experimental data analysis and computational fluid dynamics.
- Contributing to open-source tools in scientific computing and numerical physics.
